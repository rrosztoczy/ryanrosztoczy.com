  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>My current priority is <strong>Mainstreet AI</strong>, which I started in late 2023. As a side project, I am documenting "the machine" as I dogfood my own platform.</p>
  <p><a href="machine.html">The Machine - Mainstreet's AI Operating System</a></p>
  <p>Topics of interest:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Agency</li>
    <li>AI as a democratizing force for opportunity</li>
    <li>Business as a Natural Science</li>
    <li>Bootstrapping</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Previously I was the founding engineer at <strong>Gather Learning</strong>, which was acquired in 2024. I studied at Stanford, where despite acing computer science I convinced myself I could never program (for 5 years, at least) and focused on writing. I briefly tried my hand at podcasting where I met a number of CEOs and founders that have changed my life for good.</p>
